# Hack The Box Writeups
In this repository you can find my writeups for Hack The Box machines.
If the machines are old, pdf files are encrypted with root flag. For the new machine, since March 2020 (see new HTB rules), they are protected with Administrator hash (Windows) or root hash (Linux).

For more details check my site
https://samuelpiatanesi.altervista.org/hackthebox.php
They are available in two different languages, Italian and English version.
After a machine is retired, I will remove the protection, and the writeups will be "Free Access".
